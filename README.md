OOP Practice Programs

This project contains Java programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, classes, objects, constructors, and methods. The programs are divided into two levels of complexity: Level 1 (basic) and Level 2 (intermediate), organized in separate directories.

Project Structure





level1/: Contains basic OOP programs for beginners.





level1_Employee.java: Models an employee with attributes (name, ID, salary) and a method to display details.



level1_Item.java: Represents an inventory item with attributes (item code, name, price) and methods to display details and calculate total cost.



level1_Circle.java: Models a circle with a radius attribute and methods to calculate and display area and circumference.



level1_MobilePhone.java: Represents a mobile phone with attributes (brand, model, price) and a method to display details.



level2/: Contains intermediate OOP programs with additional logic and functionality.





level2_Student.java: Models a student with attributes (name, roll number, marks) and methods to calculate grade and display details.



level2_BankAccount.java: Simulates a bank account with attributes (account holder, account number, balance) and methods for depositing, withdrawing, and displaying balance.



level2_PalindromeChecker.java: Checks if a given text is a palindrome with a method to display the result.



level2_MovieTicket.java: Models a movie ticket with attributes (movie name, seat number, price) and methods to book a ticket and display details.



level2_CartItem.java: Simulates a shopping cart item with attributes (item name, price, quantity) and methods to add/remove items and calculate total cost.

OOP Concepts Demonstrated





Encapsulation: Private fields with public methods (getters/setters or other operations) to control data access.



Classes and Objects: Each program defines a class as a blueprint and creates objects to demonstrate instantiation.



Constructors: Used to initialize object attributes in all programs.



Methods: Define behaviors such as displaying details, performing calculations, or modifying object state.



Naming Conventions: Follows Java standards (camelCase for attributes and methods, PascalCase for class names).



Comments: Included for clarity and readability in the code.

How to Run





Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.



Navigate to the level1 or level2 directory.



Compile a program using javac <filename>.java (e.g., javac level1_Employee.java).



Run the program using java <className> (e.g., java Employee).



Each program includes a main method with sample output for testing.

Prerequisites





Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.



A terminal or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for compiling and running Java files.
